Scripts for Looking up OUIs or Vendor information from MAC addresses

Note that the Windows version uses c:\utils for both the script and the downloaded text file
The Linux version downloads the text file to $HOME/Downloads, the script can reside anywhere

Edit the script you are using if these directories are not desirable in your situation
